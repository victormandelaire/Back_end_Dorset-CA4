# Back_end_Dorset-CA4
This is a Flask application for managing todos. 
It allows users to create, read, update, and delete todos. 
The application uses a MongoDB database to store the todos.

The application has several routes, each handling a specific task. 
The home page shows a list of all todos and allows users to create new todos. 

The application uses several Python packages, including Flask, PyMongo, and BSON. 
It connects to a MongoDB database using a MongoClient and inserts, retrieves, updates, and deletes data using the PyMongo package.

Users can interact with the application by entering data into HTML forms and clicking buttons.
The application responds to these actions by rendering templates or redirecting the user to different pages.
